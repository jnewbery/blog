excerpt: A talk at the Recurse Center in New York titled "Bitcoin for Hackers".
---

I gave a talk at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in New York
titled "Bitcoin for Hackers" (so-named because the previous name for the
Recurse Center was Hacker School). The talk was a very quick introduction to
electronic coins, the double-spend problem, and how Bitcoin solves that problem
with proof of work.

Slides and Jupyter notebook are available [here](https://github.com/jnewbery/bitcoin_for_hackers).
