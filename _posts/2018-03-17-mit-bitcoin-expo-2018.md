I was on a [panel at the 2017 MIT Bitcoin
Expo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl1a5hLLqU0&feature=youtu.be&t=4410) with
Cory Fields and Andrew Poelstra, hosted by Paul Wegzyn. The audio is very poor
for the first fifteen minutes of the video, but improves after that.

We talked about scalability, protocol development and the difference between
onchain transactions and layer 2 solutions.
