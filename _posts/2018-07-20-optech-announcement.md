Steve Lee and I announced the launch of [Optech](https://bitcoinops.org) at
Distributed 2018 in [a chat with Aaron Van
Wirdum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEt3sgctE6w&feature=youtu.be).

We talked about what led us to start Bitcoin Optech and what we hoped to
achieve with the project.

Optech's launch was covered in [Bitcoin
Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/chaincode-devs-google-alumni-create-industry-group-help-bitcoin-scale)
and
[Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/07/20/bitcoins-biggest-startups-are-backing-a-new-effort-to-keep-fees-low/).
