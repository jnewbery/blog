excerpt: A presentation about Scaling Bitcoin operations.
---

I gave a talk to BitMEX engineers about "Scaling Bitcoin Operations". In the talk
I gave a background on Bitcoin's fee market and Bitcoin Optech, spoke about various
techniques available today for reducing transaction fees (payment batching, segwit
and patient spending), and discussed upcoming techniques for reducing fees
(Lightning Network, Schnorr signatures and Threshold/multisignatures).
