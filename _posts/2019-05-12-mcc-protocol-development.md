I was on a [panel discussing Bitcoin Protocol
Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFN__b6ARH4&feature=youtu.be&t=15940)
with Eric Lombrozo, Matt Corallo and Luke Dashjr, hosted by Katherine Wu at the
Magical Crypto Conference 2019.

We talked about:

- How changes are made to the Bitcoin protocol
- How the schnorr/taproot softfork will improve privacy and fungibility in Bitcoin
- The Binance hack and the possibility of exchanges attempting deep reorgs
- Maximalism and other blockchain projects
