excerpt: A chat with Peter McCormack about Bitcoin Development.
---

In [this
interview](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/john-newbery-on-building-a-bitcoin-developer-community),
I explained to Peter what working on the Bitcoin protocol is like, the risks of
a reducing block subsidy for miners, and privacy and development on the
Lightning network.

Peter also spoke to 3 of the residents on the Chaincode Summer Residency. They
talked about their diverse backgrounds, how they ended up in New York, and what
they'll be working on once the residency is over.
