excerpt: I spoke to Peter McCormack about Bitcoin Development.

In this interview, I explained to Peteer what working on the Bitcoin
protocol is like, the risks of a reducing block subsidy for
miners, and privacy and development on the Lightning network.

Peter also spoke to 3 of the residents on the Chaincode Summer Residency. They
talked about their diverse backgrounds, how they ended up in New York, and what
they'll be working on once the residency is over.
