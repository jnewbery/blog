excerpt: A podcast about Bitcoin protocol development featuring interviews with the most influential Bitcoin engineers.

I started [a podcast](https://podcast.chaincode.com/) with Adam Jonas at
[Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/). We interviewed influential Bitcoin
protocol developers about deep technical topics in Bitcoin development.  While
I was at Chaincode, we produced 7 episodes:

- (1 & 2) [Pieter Wuille on Headers-first sync'ing, ultraprune, the March 2013 consensus fork, BIP66 and libsecp](https://podcast.chaincode.com/2020/01/27/pieter-wuille-1.html)

- (3) [Jeremy Rubin on CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY](https://podcast.chaincode.com/2020/01/30/jeremy-rubin-3.html)

- (4) [James O'Beirne on AssumeUTXO](https://podcast.chaincode.com/2020/02/12/james-obeirne-4.html)

- (5) [A special episode explaining the UTXO set](https://podcast.chaincode.com/2020/02/26/utxos-5.html)

- (6) [Matt Corallo on Compact Blocks and FIBRE](https://podcast.chaincode.com/2020/03/12/matt-corallo-6.html)

- (7) [Nadav Kohen on Payment Points](https://podcast.chaincode.com/2020/03/30/nadav-cohen-7.html)

I was very happy to see that after a long hiatus, the Chaincode podcast
continued with Adam Jonas and Mark Erhardt hosting. They've had some great
guests, including Carl Dong, Pieter Wuille and Clara Shikhelman.
