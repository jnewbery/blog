excerpt: An interview with Christian Keroles about Bitcoin open source development.
---

In [this
interview](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/interview-developing-bitcoin-with-john-newbery),
I talked to Christian Keroles to discuss why I started Brink, and the process of
establishing the organization.

Christian then turned the conversation to the bigger picture of Bitcoin
development. We discussed the difference in developing Bitcoin in a bear
market versus a bull market, what the Bitcoin development process looks like
and how a distributed group of stakeholders can make sure that developers are
working on the most important things in the protocol.

Lastly, we discussed Taproot and how it demonstrates that the Bitcoin community
has improved its coordination. We also discussed the concept of ossification
in the Bitcoin protocol and how developers think about Bitcoin's code.

Additional topics discussed included:

- Launching Brink with Mike Schmitt
- Bitcoin Optech
- Becoming a 501(c)(3) nonprofit
- How the donation landscape is changing for Bitcoin development
- Comparing and contrasting development in a bull vs. bear market
- Bitcoin and ossification
- Reflecting on the taproot process
