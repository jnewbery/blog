excerpt: A podcast about Bitcoin protocol development.

[Gloria](https://twitter.com/glozow) and I started [a podcast about
Bitcoin protocol development](https://brink.dev/podcast). We plan to get very
technical and explore areas of the protocol and code that you won't hear about
on other podcasts! Join us to learn about how Bitcoin is built, and what protocol
developers think about when they're working on the code.
