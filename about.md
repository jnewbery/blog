Hi. I'm John. I'm a software developer/manager and company founder/director
with over 12 years experience working on protocol development, peer to peer
networks, and open source projects.

In 2020, I established [Brink](https://brink.dev) to solve three problems:

- Making sure that established protocol developers had sustainable funding and
  could focus 100% of their energy on engineering work instead of worrying
  about fundraising.

- Ensuring that donors funds were effectively used. Sourcing and funding
  extremely talented engineers and providing transparency about how
  the funding was being used.

- Providing mentoring and coaching for exceptionally talented but less
  experienced protocol developers.

Brink's mission was to support Bitcoin development by supporting Bitcoin
developers. Whilst I was Executive Director, we raised $4 million and funded 7
open source developers.

Prior to founding Brink, I was at Chaincode Labs in New York, where I spent my
time contributing to [Bitcoin Core][] and running various education and
mentoring projects.

In 2018, I organised the second [Chaincode Residency][] and 
[Chaincode Lightning Apps Residency][], and in 2019 I helped run the fourth
Chaincode residency.

I started [Bitcoin Optech][] in 2018 to help Bitcoin businesses adopt scaling
technologies and improve communication between the Bitcoin open source
community and businesses using Bitcoin.

I co-organized and co-hosting the New York [BitDevs Socratic Meetups][] from
2018 to 2020.

In 2019, I started the [Bitcoin Core PR Review Club][] to help newer
contributors learn about the Bitcoin Core review process.
