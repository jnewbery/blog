I'm a Bitcoin protocl developer. I work at Chaincode Labs in New York,
where I spend my time contributing to open source Bitcoin projects. I want to
help make Bitcoin the best kind of money the world has ever had - secure,
private, fungible and scalable. I also care about spreading knowledge about
Bitcoin and Bitcoin development, and helping onboard new contributors to the
project.

I started contributing to [Bitcoin Core][] in late 2016, when I attended the
[first Chaincode residency][]. I've contributed code and review to most parts
of the codebase including validation, networking, wallet, GUI and test
framework.

In 2018, I organised the second [Chaincode residency][] and helped organize the
[Chaincode Lightning Apps Residency][], and in 2019 I helped run the fourth
Chaincode residency.

I started [Bitcoin Optech][] in 2018 to help Bitcoin businesses adopt scaling
technologies and improve communication between the Bitcoin open source
community and businesses using Bitcoin.

I started co-hosting the New York [BitDevs socratic meetups][] in 2018.

In 2019, I started the [Bitcoin Core PR Review Club][] to help newer
contributors learn about the Bitcoin Core review process.
