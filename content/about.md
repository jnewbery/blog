### About me

I spend most of my time writing code for Bitcoin Core or thinking about Bitcoin. I work at Chaincode Labs in New York, where I have a lot of freedom to work on projects that I think are important or interesting.

Some projects I work on are:

- [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin)
- [Bitcoin Optech](https://bitcoinops.org)
- Chaincode's [Bitcoin](http://hackerresidency.com) and [Lightning Applications](http://lightningresidency.com) residency programs
